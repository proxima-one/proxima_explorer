# Proxima Explorer

The explorer is designed to show the services available within the nodes registered in proxima registry. 

[Explorer]()

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/proxima-one/proxima_explorer
cd proxima_explorer
npm install
npm start
```


## Use

```
npm start
```

Upon deploying the explorer will be deployed to localhost:3000. 

#### Output
 
```console

The service interface should look like this. 

## Next Steps

We are looking to integrate a better user interface into our registry, and develop an api that can be used without the registry client.
